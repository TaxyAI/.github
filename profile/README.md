# Taxy AI
Taxy AI is an organization dedicated to revolutionizing the role that AI plays in human-computer interaction. On March 28th, 2023, Taxy AI released its first public project, a self-hosted Chrome Extension with the ability to accomplish a user's natural language command by interacting with their browser.

While our progress up to this point is exciting, there's even more work ahead of us. New features like voice-to-command, support for future LLM's, and auto-streamlined workflows will keep the community busy for some time. Check out the [chrome-extension](https://github.com/TaxyAI/chrome-extension) and [experiments](https://github.com/TaxyAI/experiments) repositories in this organization. If you're excited about the idea of revamping how humans interact with their computers, please don't hesitate to join the discord channel, open a GitHub issue, or submit a PR!

Welcome to the age of AI!
